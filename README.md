## Overview
- This super-simple set of Python scripts uses the following components to measure the distance between the sensor and a surface:
    - ultrasonic sensor
    - piezoelectric buzzer
- The exercises gives an introduction to how a radar operates
- It is comparable to the operation of a car parking sensor; something which many individuals are familiar with
- In addition to the coding element, individuals can also construct the accompanying circuit
    - Could be provided pre-constructed for those who are already unfamiliar with coding to avoid being overwhelmed?

## Audience
- The intended audience for this content is high school aged people between 14-18 years old
- I plan to create different difficulties of exercises for people with varying degrees of coding experience, ranging from _'no experience'_ to _'very experienced'_

## IT Requirements
- A computer with the following software installed
    - Thonny (easiest)
    - Visual Studio Code
- A microcontroller
    - Arduino Uno
    - Raspberry Pi Pico
